#   When true, the probe will stay attached to the toolhead after the
#   completion of a command in case there is another command requiring the
#   use of the probe in the command queue. Once all commands have completed,
#   the probe is docked. It is recommended to add the DETACH_PROBE command to
#   macros and slicer start gcode to ensure the probe is correctly detached.
